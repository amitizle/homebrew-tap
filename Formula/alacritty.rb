  def caveats
    msg = <<~EOS

      There's no configuration file in this formula. I'm using my own dotfiles repo to symlink my config
      into ~/.config/alacritty.

      WARNING: This formula can't install into /Applications, the application
      has been installed to:

        #{prefix / "Applications/Alacritty.app"}

      This path is stable across upgrades, you can create your own symlink in
      the global /Applications folder as follows:

        ln -s #{prefix / "Applications/Alacritty.app"} /Applications/

    # `test do` will create, run in and delete a temporary directory.
    #
    # This test will fail and we won't accept that! It's enough to just replace
    # "false" with the main program this formula installs, but it'd be nice if you
    # were more thorough. Run the test with `brew test alacritty`. Options passed
    # to `brew install` such as `--HEAD` also need to be provided to `brew test`.
    #
    # The installed folder is not in the path, so use the entire path to any
    # executables being tested: `system "#{bin}/program", "do", "something"`.
